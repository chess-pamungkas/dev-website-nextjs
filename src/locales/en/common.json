  "forex_faq-content5": "The price of forex CFDs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic data, central bank policies, geopolitical events, and changes in interest rates.

  "forex_faq-title6": "What are the benefits of trading forex CFDs?",
  "forex_faq-content6": "One of the main benefits of trading forex CFDs is the ability to speculate on the price movements of currency pairs without owning the underlying assets.

  "forex_faq-title7": "What are the risks of trading forex CFDs?",
  "forex_faq-content7": "As with any type of trading, there are risks involved with trading forex CFDs. The use of leverage can amplify potential losses as well as potential profits, and traders may be subject to margin calls if the value of their positions falls below a certain level. Additionally, factors that affect the price of forex pairs, such as economic data and geopolitical events, can be difficult to predict, which can result in losses for traders.",
  "forex_faq-title8": "What are the trading strategies for forex CFDs?",
  "forex_faq-content8": "Some common trading strategies for forex CFDs include trend following, mean reversion, and news trading. Trend following involves following the direction of the market trend, while mean reversion involves trading against the trend in the hopes that the price will revert to its mean. News trading involves taking advantage of short-term price movements that occur in response to economic news or events. It's important to choose a trading strategy that aligns with your trading style and risk tolerance.",

  "indices_faq-content1": "Trading Indices allows a trader to have access to several companies in one trade and further diversify their portfolio.",
  "indices_faq-content1-2": "An Index is a measurement of the price performance of a group of shares from an exchange. For example, the FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100) is an index of the biggest 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange.",
  "indices_faq-title2": "Why is it important to understand Indices?",
  "indices_faq-content2": "Imagine a basket of shares in one Index but not all the shares have the same value. So, you need to know how the overall Index is calculated? Most Indices use market capitalisation weighting and what this means is the more the share value a stock has, the more weight it is given in the calculation of the overall Index.",
  "indices_faq-title3": "What are indices CFDs?",
  "indices_faq-content3": "Indices CFDs are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of an index without owning the underlying assets. An index is a basket of stocks that are grouped together based on a certain criteria, such as market capitalization or sector.",
  "indices_faq-title4": "What factors affect the price of indices CFDs?",
  "indices_faq-content4": "The price of indices CFDs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic data, corporate earnings reports, central bank policies, geopolitical events, and changes in interest rates. For example, if economic data suggests that a country's economy is growing, this can cause the price of that country's index to rise.",
  "indices_faq-title5": "What are the benefits of trading indices CFDs?",
  "indices_faq-content5": "One of the main benefits of trading indices CFDs is the ability to speculate on the price movements of an index without owning the underlying assets. CFDs also offer leverage, which allows traders to amplify their potential profits. Additionally, CFDs are typically traded on margin, which means that traders can open positions with a fraction of the total trade value.",
  "indices_faq-title6": "When trading indices CFDs, there are some risks to consider, such as:",
  "indices_faq-content6-a": "- Market volatility: The underlying index's value can change rapidly, leading to gains or losses.",
  "indices_faq-content6-b": "- Leverage: CFDs are often traded with leverage, which means that traders can control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. While this can increase potential profits, it can also result in amplified losses.",
  "indices_faq-content6-c": "- Liquidity: CFD liquidity can be influenced by various factors, including market volatility and the size of the position. In times of low liquidity, it may be challenging to enter or exit a trade at the desired price. As such, it's crucial to choose a reputable CFD provider with deep liquidity, such as OQtima, to ensure you have a positive trading experience. OQtima is committed to providing its clients with access to top-tier liquidity and advanced trading technology, making it a reliable choice for traders looking to trade indices CFDs.",
  "indices_faq-title7": "What are the trading strategies for indices CFDs?",
  "indices_faq-content7": "Some common trading strategies for indices CFDs include trend following, mean reversion, and news trading. Trend following involves following the direction of the market trend, while mean reversion involves trading against the trend in the hopes that the price will revert to its mean. News trading involves taking advantage of short-term price movements that occur in response to economic news or events. It's important to choose a trading strategy that aligns with your trading style and risk tolerance.",

  "shares_faq-content2-3": "The swap rate is displayed in your platform as percentage per annum and can be calculated using the following formula; Market Price (*EOD) X Trade size in lots X Swap rate / 100 / 360 = Swap charge per night in USD *EOD = End of Day",

  "shares_faq-title3": "What are CFD shares?",
  "shares_faq-content3": "CFD shares are contracts that allow you to speculate on the price movements of shares without actually owning the underlying asset. This means you can profit from both rising and falling share prices.",
  "shares_faq-title4": "How does CFD shares trading work?",
  "shares_faq-content4": "When you trade CFD shares, you agree to exchange the difference in the price of the underlying share between the opening and closing of the contract. If you buy and the share price rises, you make a profit, and if it falls, you make a loss. You can go long (buy) if you think the price will rise, or go short (sell) if you think the price will fall.",
  "shares_faq-title5": "What are the benefits of CFD shares trading?",
  "shares_faq-content5": "Some of the benefits of CFD shares trading include the ability to profit from both rising and falling markets, leverage (which also brings higher risks), and the ability to trade on margin.",
  "shares_faq-title6": "How do I manage risk when trading CFD shares?",
  "shares_faq-content6": "To manage risk when trading CFD shares, you can use stop loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you. You can also limit your position size and avoid over-leveraging your trades.",
  "shares_faq-title7": "Are there any taxes on CFD shares trading?",
  "shares_faq-content7": "Taxes on CFD shares trading vary depending on the country you are trading from. In some countries, profits from CFD trading are subject to capital gains tax, while in other countries they are tax-free.",

  "faq_metals-q1": "Can I take delivery of the underlying metal?",
  "faq_metals-a1": "OQtima only offers CFDs and does not support physical delivery of the asset. When trading CFD’s you are trading based on price speculation, you are not physically buying or selling the instruments. If you open a trade in gold, you do not physically own that amount of gold, but you can earn profit or loss depending on the market movement.",
  "faq_metals-q2": "What are the platform asset codes for metals?",
  "faq_metals-a2": "All metals have their own internationally recognised 3 letter codes. XAU is the code for Gold and as all our metals are traded against US Dollar you will see the pair XAUUSD. This shows us 1 ounce of gold price per dollar unit.",

  "faq_energies-q1": "Is there any commission when trading Energies?",
  "faq_energies-a1": "There are no extra commission fees charged when opening or closing positions on energies. The cost of the trade is the spread only and this can be calculated in real time depending on your trade size.",
  "faq_energies-q2": "What is the spot price?",
  "faq_energies-a2": "The term Spot simply refers to the fact you are trading using the current delivery price, as opposed to a future contract. Unlike future contracts, you have no expiration date with spot contracts.Trading CFD spot energies, but you are not taking physical ownership of the goods, you are simply trading based on price speculation.",

  "faq_shares-title": "Shares",
  "faq_shares-q1": "Can I sell as well as buy shares?",
  "faq_shares-a1": "All our shares are CFDs which means you get to buy and sell without having to purchase the underlying share. Remember a CFD is when you are speculating on the price movement. So, you are not limited to only buying a share, you can open either a buy or sell trade and your profit/loss will be determined by the difference between the open and close price.",
  "faq_shares-q2": "Is there a time limit to my trade?",
  "faq_shares-a2": "You can hold a position for as long as you want, provided you have enough margin to cover your trade. There are rollover fees, also known as swap which is a financing charge, and this is applied to any trade kept open overnight or for shares, past the time of market closing for the relevant stock. The swap rate is displayed in your platform as percentage per annum and can be calculated using the following formula.",
  "faq_shares-a2-2": "Market Price (*EOD) X Trade size in lots X Swap rate / 100 / 360 = Swap charge per night in USD",
  "faq_shares-a2-3": "*EOD = End of Day",

  "faq_indices-title": "Indices",
  "faq_indices-q1": "Why trade Indices?",
  "faq_indices-a1": "Trading Indices allows a trader to have access to several companies in one trade and further diversify their portfolio. An Index is a measurement of the price performance of a group of shares from an exchange. For example, the FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100) is na index of the biggest 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange.",
  "faq_indices-q2": "Why is it important to understand Indices?",
  "faq_indices-a2": "Imagine a basket of shares in one Index but not all the shares have the same value. So, you need to know how the overall Index is calculated?",
  "faq_indices-a2-2": "Most Indices use market capitalisation weighting and what this means is the more the share value a stock has, the more weight it is given in the calculation of the overall Index.",

  "faq_beginners-title": "Beginners Terminology",
  "faq_beginners-q1": "CFD",
  "faq_beginners-a1": "Stands for Contracts for Difference and is an agreement (contract) to exchange the difference in the value of na underlying asset (FX, Metals, Indices, Energies, Shares, Cryptocurrencies), from the point at which the contract is opened to when it is closed. You speculate on the price movement in either direction without having to take physical ownership or purchase of the underlying asset and your profit or loss is determined by the difference between the open and close price.",
  "faq_beginners-a1-2": "For example: if you buy a ‘contract for difference’ at $20 and sell at $25 then you will receive the $5 difference. If you buy a CFD at $10 and sell at $5 then you pay the $5 difference. A CFD contract means that you are not physically buying the underlying asset, but you have exposure to the price movement.",
  "faq_beginners-q2": "SPREAD",
  "faq_beginners-a2": "When trading CFDs prices are quoted in two prices: the buying price and the selling price.",
  "faq_beginners-a2-2": "→ The selling price (or bid price) is the price at which you can open a sell/short trade",
  "faq_beginners-a2-3": "→ The buying price (or ask price) is the price at which you can open a buy/long trade. The BUY price, also referred to as the ASK price is always higher than the current market price, and the SELL or BID price will be slightly lower. The difference between the two prices is referred to as the spread and this is typically the trade cost deducted by the broker.",
  "faq_beginners-a2-4": "As an example, you are trading an FX pair and you are quoted two prices.",
  "faq_beginners-a2-5": "SELL/BID price = 1.0498",
  "faq_beginners-a2-6": "BUY/ASK price = 1.0500",
  "faq_beginners-a2-7": "The difference between the two prices above is 2 pips and this is the spread that is deducted from your open trade when you first open the position.",
  "faq_beginners-a2-8": "Spreads are typically floating and can be impacted by a range of factors such as liquidity, volatility, and volume of the asset.",
  "faq_beginners-q3": "LEVERAGE & MARGIN",
  "faq_beginners-a3": "Trading CFDs using leverage means you can multiply your buying power and open a position larger than your deposit would usually allow. It is also referred to as ‘margin trading’ because the amount of margin (capital) you would use to open a trade depends on the leverage you choose when you open the account and the lot size you decide to trade. The higher your leverage, the less funds are required to place a trade and vice versa.",
  "faq_beginners-a3-2": "Leverage can be displayed in ratio or percentage format, so it is good to understand how it works. For example, 1:10 leverage in percentage is 10% meaning that the margin required is 10% of the value of the trade.",
  "faq_beginners-a3-3": "Trading with leverage allows you the advantage of spreading your capital further, however, your profit or loss is still calculated based on the size of your position and is not affected by your leverage. That means both profits and losses can be magnified compared to your initial deposit, and losses can exceed deposits. It is important to make sure that you are trading within your means.",
  "faq_beginners-q4": "PIPS & POINTS",
  "faq_beginners-a4": "Understanding the value of your PIPS (point in percentage) and POINTS is essential to calculating your profit or loss. In FX we refer to PIPs a lot, as this is the smallest increment in which a currency pair can move. For most FX pairs the last digit in the price quote is the PIP except for the major FX Pairs which are quoted to 5 digits after the decimal and the last digit is a point which is a fraction of a pip. 10points = 1 Pip.",
  "faq_beginners-a4-2": "Therefore to calculate the profit or loss, you need to determine your PIP or POINT value. To do this you would multiply the trade size of the position (total number of contracts) by the value of each contract (expressed per point of movement). You then multiply that figure by the difference in points between the price when you opened the contract and when you closed it.",
  "faq_beginners-a4-3": "Remember that leverage does not affect the pip value. The only thing that will affect the pip value is the size of the trade. For other asset classes and other brokers, they may be quoted differently. This can be verified on the platform under the instrument specifications.",
  "faq_beginners-q5": "MARGIN CALL & STOP OUT",
  "faq_beginners-a5": "Margin call occurs when you do not have enough funds in your account to cover the losses of open positions. This is an important feature of a trading platform, to ensure your losses are limited.",
  "faq_beginners-a5-2": "‘Stop Out’ is the forced automatic closure of trades when the account equity falls below a certain level. The Margin level % is calculated as Equity (Equity means the balance + unrealised P&L)/ Margin (required margin for the open positions) x 100 The margin level is displayed on the platform as a % at any time you have open positions.",
  "faq_beginners-a5-3": "Stop Outs help to prevent trading accounts from falling into a negative balance, however, in very volatile markets, or during market gaps, it is not always possible to fill orders at a specific level and there might be significant slippage when Stop out orders are executed.",
  "faq_beginners-q6": "STOP LOSS",
  "faq_beginners-a6": "A ‘Stop Loss’ order is a trigger you can set on your trade to limit losses on your trade should the price of the asset you are trading move in an unprofitable direction.",
  "faq_beginners-a6-2": "You can set a stop loss to your trade at the time you place it or later by modifying the trade. This will automatically trigger and close the trade once the market price reaches the stop loss price you have set.",
  "faq_beginners-a6-3": "A Stop Loss must be placed below the current market price on Buy positions, and above the current market price on Sell positions.",
  "faq_beginners-a6-4": "All Stop Orders, including Stop Losses are closed with Market Execution. This means, once the Stop Loss is triggered, it will be closed at the price that is available in the market at that time (it will be closed at VWAP). This price may be above, on, or below the requested price.",
  "faq_beginners-q7": "TAKE PROFIT",
  "faq_beginners-a7": "A ‘Take Profit’ order is a trigger used to lock in profits at a specified price. This will automatically trigger and close the trade once the market price reaches the take profit price you have set.",
  "faq_beginners-a7-2": "A Take Profit must be placed above the current market price on Buy positions, and below the current market price on Sell positions.",
  "faq_beginners-a7-3": "Take profits on long positions will be triggered for execution once the ‘BID’ price reaches your take profit level. Take profits on short positions will be triggered for execution once the ‘ASK’ price reaches your take profit level.",
